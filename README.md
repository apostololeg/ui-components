# UILIB

Design system that makes building web applications with ReactJS faster and easier.

It's a collection of pre-built components, guidelines, and best practices that help you create high-quality user interfaces with less code.

## Best practices

Codebase are folows software development principles: DRY, KISS, SOLID.

### Tree shakable

UILIB is designed to make your web application run faster by only including the components that are actually used in your code. This reduces the amount of code that needs to be loaded, which makes your application load faster and run more smoothly.

### Typescript support

UILIB is designed to work well with Typescript, which is a popular programming language that helps you write more reliable and maintainable code. With UILIB, you get all the benefits of Typescript, like better error messages and more accurate code completion, to make your development experience smoother and more productive.

### SSR compatible

The components can be used in projects with SSR enabled. Check the test project [uilib-next](https://github.com/foreverido/uilib-nextjs)

## Perspective

There's still a lot of work to be done to make it shine âœ¨
